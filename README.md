## Getting Started/User Stories

Welcome to My Flashcard Pokédex! Click this link to get started. (https://flashcard-pokedex.netlify.app/)

To begin, select a generation of Pokémon games from the drop-down menu. The page will load with flippable cards revealing the Pokémon's name, National Pokédex number, and physical information. Its background color(s) correspond with its primary type, as well as a secondary type, if it has one.

Clicking/tapping on a Pokémon will flip the card, revealing a Pokédex entry. To jump to the bottom of the page, simply click/tap the header image at the top. Clicking/tapping the "Top" link at the bottom of the page will have the reverse effect.

Though it includes all main game generations, this Dex does not include Form changes, Mega Evolutions, or regional differences.


## Stretch Goals

Code-wise, if possible, I would like to refactor the Javascript code to operate more without a setTimeout function, instead utilizing more advanced AJAX functions. I'd like to simplify the HTML I used for the codes, but that comes with understanding the CSS for flipping cards more clearly. 

I'd also like to add an audio button with a mute feature. It would be positioned at the corner of the header image and play a short musical loop from each game generation!
