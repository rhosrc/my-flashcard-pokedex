## Getting Started/User Stories

Welcome to My Flashcard Pokédex! Click the link to get started. (https://flashcard-pokedex.netlify.app/)

To begin, select a generation of Pokémon games from the drop-down menu and confirm your choice. The page will load with flippable cards revealing Pokémon names, National Pokédex numbers, and physical data. Background color(s) of cards correspond with their primary type, as well as a secondary type, if they have one.

Clicking/tapping a Pokémon card will flip it, revealing a Pokédex entry. To jump to the bottom of the page and select another generation, simply click/tap the header image at the top. Clicking/tapping the "Top" link at the bottom of the page will send you back to the top of the page.

Though it includes all main game generations, this Dex does not include Form changes, Mega Evolutions, or regional differences.


## Stretch Goals

Code-wise, if possible, I would like to refactor the Javascript to operate without a setTimeout function, instead utilizing more advanced AJAX functions. I'd like to simplify the HTML I used for the cards, but that comes with understanding the CSS for flipping cards more clearly. 

I'd also like to add a small audio button with a mute feature. It would be positioned at the corner of the header image and play a short musical loop from the selected game generation!
